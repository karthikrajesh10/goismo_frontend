This project is a simple **dashboard UI** built with modern frontend technologies.  
It replicates a professional e-commerce / operations dashboard with sections for **actions, statistics, charts, and services**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vite** → Development bundler for faster builds and hot reloading  
- **Tailwind CSS** → Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive layouts  
- **Lucide React** → Icon library used for colorful, clean vector icons  
- **Recharts** → Charting library for displaying orders & payments data  

---

## 📌 Features

- 📊 **Stats Cards** with colorful icons and faded backgrounds  
- ✅ **Action Cards** (Certification, Upload Product, Open for Sale) with gradient styles and a "Go" button  
- 📈 **Chart Section** using Recharts (Orders & Payments this week)  
- 🛠️ **Service Cards** styled similar to WeChat dashboard
